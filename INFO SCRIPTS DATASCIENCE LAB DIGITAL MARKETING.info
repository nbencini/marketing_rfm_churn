GUIDELINES scripts

-	each step corresponds to a separate script:
	use a prefix to handle the sequentiality of the script:
		A00_main.R
		B01_ingestion.R
		C01_preparation_xyz.R
		...

-	in A00_main.R scripts:
	import all the variables (add all the libraries used in the following scripts)
	map all the script sequence in PIPELINE_scripts
	
	declare the path of the directory containing the data in your local environment (data_dir)
		NB all the data files must be in the same directory
		
	declare the path of the working directory in your local environment (working_dir)
	
	use the 'EXECUTION FULL PIPELINE' script to run all the scripts in sequence
	
-	in following scripts there are parts left to the students
	these are referred as '#### ???? TO DO <...> ???? ####'
